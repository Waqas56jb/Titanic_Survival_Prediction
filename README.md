 
**Titanic Survival Prediction Project**

Welcome to my Titanic survival prediction project repository! This project was completed as part of my internship at @CodeAlpha, @Encryptix @DEP 
### Project Overview:
- **Objective:** Utilize Decision Tree classification 🌳 to predict Titanic passenger survival.
- **Key Features Analyzed:** Fare 💵, Age 🎂, Passenger Class 🎫.
- **Tools Used:** Python (NumPy 🧮, Pandas 🐼, Matplotlib 📊, Seaborn 🐬).

### Key Achievements:
- Implemented robust data analysis and visualization techniques.
- Utilized scatter plots 📈 for insightful data exploration.
- Enhanced understanding of machine learning concepts and practical application.

### How to Use:
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Install the necessary Python libraries (`requirements.txt` provided).
3. Explore the Jupyter Notebook (`Titanic_Survival_Prediction.ipynb`) for detailed code and insights.

### Future Improvements:
- Explore additional machine learning models for comparison.
- Enhance visualization techniques for clearer insights.
